# Dashboard Reborn✨

A very sexy Flutter template app with great focus on UI, design and animations. Based on [Flutter Dashboard](https://github.com/Ivaskuu/dashboard), [Story App UI](https://github.com/devefy/Flutter-Story-App-UI) and many other open source Flutter projects listed on [Awesome Flutter](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter).

## Usage💻

There are three main pages in the app:
- **About Page:** a clean, neutral cards layout mostly consisting of text.
- **Material Page:** a lively, heavily animated page consisting of bold Material Design colors.
- **Gradients Page:** a beautiful paginated cards layout complete with a colorful gradients theme.

You can use these individual components or all of them together as a template or starting point in your own Flutter app. It's completely free, as in beer and speech!

That said, if you liked this project and found it helpful, kindly fork/star this repo to show your support, and perhaps checkout some of [my other projects](https://github.com/urmilshroff?tab=repositories). It really helps!😁

## Building🛠

To build and run the app on your device, do the following:

-   [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/) by following the instructions on their website
-   Fork/clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/urmilshroff/dashboard_reborn.git`
-   Connect your devices/emulators and run the app using `flutter run --release` in the root of the project directory.

**Note:** you can also run it faster in debug mode using 'flutter run', but the animations will be choppy and performance won't be as expected.
